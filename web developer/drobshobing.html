Many people in the Arab region do not know what dropshipping is, but in short, it is a way to profit through the Internet without having to buy products or store them and then deliver them, and thus it is an opportunity to sell products that you do not own, but through which you make a profit! So how is it done? Simply
All you have to do is start with Knawat with a ready-made store from Wilt or look for a supplier that sells dropshipping products so you can sell them without buying them! Note that the supplier is the one who will deliver the product to the customer, and therefore your role is to market these products and every sale made through you will profit from them. </p>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ul2">
        <h2>
            1. No capital required
        </h2>
        <p>
            
            The most important advantage of dropshipping is that you will not need a lot of money to start your project, you do not have any obligations such as buying products, storing and shipping expenses, and even the expenses of workers to organize inventory or workers' salaries in general.
            On the contrary, with dropshipping selling, all your expenses will be to create an online store, which is almost an affordable cost compared to the cost of establishing a company or project from the ground up and registering it, and never worry about this step because it has become simple with the ready-made merchant builder in Wilt, The Wilt platform provided you with the ability to build your own store in minutes in simple steps and without the need for programming or design experience with continuous technical support service to take a ready-made online store and start selling at the lowest possible cost.</p>

           <p> In addition to the cost of the store, you may need some money to make some paid ads to promote your products on social media and Google.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ul2">
        <h2>
            2- High ☺️ flexibility
        </h2>
        <p>
           
            Any dropshipping store can be started and operated as long as you have an internet connection or mobile phone to communicate with customers and suppliers, thus saving you very much and you can enjoy your life and sell from anywhere and at any time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ul2">
        <h2>
            3- Results are fast 
        </h2>
        <p>
           
            One of the most advantages of selling through the dropshipping system is that the results are fast, whether positive or negative, as you can reach them within a very few days, and this is an excellent feature because it helps you make quick decisions that will improve your business or develop your marketing tools after measuring their effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>Based on these results, you can change the way you market, the means of marketing, or even you can change the products that are not popular despite people visiting them.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ul2">
        <h2>
            4- You can change products at any time 
        </h2>
        <p>
            
            Any online business can be easily developed and expanded, but in the case of selling with a dropshipping system, this feature is unlimited, as you can add as many products as you want, expand the lists of the offer in your store, try different products, measure what works and what does not work, and review, modify or change these products.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ul2">
        <h2>
            5- No economic losses
        </h2>
        <p>
            
            In a dropshipping system there is no risk of economic losses for you as your investment rate will be very small and you will always have a profit margin even if this margin is small or large it is another matter.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the disadvantages of dropshipping?</h2>
<img src="proplem.jpeg">
<p>
    Selling through the dropshipping system is almost an easy dream to achieve with simple steps and a way to earn money without much trouble or high cost, although there are some drawbacks in the dropshipping system that you should know before you begin:</p>

    </div>
    <div  class="ul2">
        <h2>
            1. Low profit
        </h2>
        <p>
           
            The problem of low profit is a fundamental problem, but it is almost one of the biggest problems facing sellers with a dropshipping system, due to the great and fierce competition for the same products and the ease of starting at a small cost in itself that brings thousands of people to sell compared to any other field.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="ul2">
        <h2>
            2- Requires a lot of experience in e-marketing
        </h2>
        <p>
           
            If you do not have experience in e-marketing, you should not start selling with a dropshipping system, as selling with a dropshipping system needs great experience in the field of e-marketing, and since the profit margin is very small, you have to acquire the customer at the lowest possible price, and this is a big challenge that needs great experience in paid and unpaid e-marketing blogging and archiving the site on Google, for example, to get visitors without paying a lot of money.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="ul2">
        <h2>
            3- High shipping costs 
        </h2>
        <p>
            
            It's normal for anyone who works on dropshipping to rely on more than one platform to ensure their product diversity! Here, the problem appears to the customer when he orders more than one product from different dropshipping platforms. Where each product will be ordered from a different platform at its own shipping price! If the customer incurs high shipping costs, he may retreat from completing the order, which will result in you losing the customer.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="ul2">
        <h2>
            4- You have no control over the shipping and delivery of products
        </h2>
        <p>
           
            In a dropshipping system you have no complete control over the products and their shipping. Thus if the shipment is delayed or the product is spoiled, invalid or satisfactory to the customer! You will be facing the dissatisfied or angry customer and the responsibility lies with you not on any dropshipping platform you are dealing with.
            In addition, your dealings with more than one dropshipping platform may make the shipment arrive intermittently to the customer as a productive product, which increases his anger. </p>
