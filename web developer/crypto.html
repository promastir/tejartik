                <h2 style="color :aliceblue;"> What is a digital currency? </h2>  
                <p > The digital currency is secured by cryptography so it is practically impossible for fraud to occur in its transactions. The latter problem, which does not exist with traditional currencies, involves the risk of double spending of a single digital currency. Certainly, it is a potential and different obstacle for digital currencies, relatively digital information can be easily copied from individuals (albeit unknown) who understand the blockchain network and the computer software needed to control it.

              <p> The past period has seen a major shift in digital currencies, as their growth has been faster than ever, yet their future has never been clear, as many people entered cryptocurrency trading for the first time during the Corona pandemic due to the lack of activities on which they can spend money.</p>
              <p>The trend towards digital currencies that were previously understood only among a small community of investors has increased, but now it has become a household name for everyone, and analysts estimate that the global cryptocurrency market will triple by 2030, reaching a valuation of nearly 5 billion US dollars, investors, companies and brands cannot ignore the rising tide of cryptocurrencies for a long time, whether they want to buy or not.</p>

            <img src="bitcoin.jpeg">
            <p>
                Bitcoin is the world's most popular digital currency with origins dating back to 2009; it remains the highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization today. Bitcoin operates under its blockchain umbrella, where transactions are verified, and new bitcoins are created up to a fixed limit, by a large number of decentralized miners. In January 2023, Bitcoin had the largest market capitalization of $326 billion.

            <h5>2- Ethereum</h5>
            <img src="etherum.jpeg">
            <p>
                Ethereum is the cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum runs on its own blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has no cap, which means it theoretically can create an infinite amount of currency. Ethereum also supports smart contracts. These are programs that run on their own blockchain technology that run automatically when certain conditions are met.Ethereum's market value as of the time of writing is $154 billion.

            <img src="tether.jpeg">
            <p>
               
                Tether is a type of stablecoin whose price is said to be less volatile because it is pegged to an offshore asset. In this case, each currency is backed by an amount equivalent to the US dollar, resulting in it not being exposed to the same price fluctuations as other cryptocurrencies. It has a market capitalization of $66 billion.

            <img src="light.jpeg">
            <p>
                
                Litcoin is a form of cryptocurrency, which can be used to buy and sell online and transfer money between accounts. So it's similar to Bitcoin in the value it adds, but it's unlikely to surpass it, although it has introduced a number of improvements such as reducing block creation time, thus making transactions faster. This is because Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to emerge and as it is most popular among investors and traders.

                It is the official currency of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in 2021. For users who pay in BNB, transaction fees for this exchange are reduced. This led to the adoption of Binance Coin, making it one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market right now. To ensure value stability, Binance is destroying or "burning" a fixed percentage of coins in circulation.The market capitalization is $42 billion as of January 2023.

                <h2 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Cryptocurrency Risks</h2>
                <p>Interest in the digital currency has recently increased and a group of the major company has started dealing with it, however, there are still a lot of concerns about that currency, both in terms of security and regarding the legal implications of this currency</p>

                <h2> Decentralized Cryptocurrency Status</h2>
                <p>
                   
One of the great attractions of many cryptocurrencies is also a potential risk factor for the individual investor, and Bitcoin has paved the way for other cryptocurrencies in terms of being decentralized, 
Which means that it has no physical presence and is not supported by a central authority, while governments around the world have stepped in to assert their regulatory authority in various ways, Bitcoin and other digital currencies like it remain untied to any jurisdiction or institution, on the one hand, this frees investors from being indebted to those institutions, but on the other hand, 
The value of digital currencies depends entirely on the value attributed to them by owners and other investors; this is true in all currencies, digital or fidatory, but without a central authority supporting the value of the digital currency, investors may be in trouble if complications arise in transactions or ownership.

                    Price change risk
                </h2>
                <p>
The price of cryptocurrencies fluctuates constantly, the price of cryptocurrency trading can suddenly rise or fall suddenly, and there is a possibility that the value of the cryptocurrency will fall to zero, and this is something you should keep in mind when buying.

                <p>
                   
                    The price of cryptocurrencies can flip at any time, and the markets for buying and selling cryptocurrencies may operate at specific times and close at specific times, so you cannot trade on those currencies for the hours when the markets close, regardless of the size of the change in the price of the currency.
