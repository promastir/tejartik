            <h2 style="color:aliceblue;">What is the stock market?</h2>
            <p> 
                A stock market is defined as the set of markets and exchanges from which you can buy, sell and issue shares to publicly traded companies on a daily basis. Such financial activities take place on official exchanges or OTC markets that operate according to a certain set of rules. 
            While the terms "stock market" and "stock exchange" are used on a mutually reciprocal basis, the latter term is a subset of the former.

                    In any country or region, there can be several stock markets that allow stock trading transactions or other types of financial instrument transactions.
                </p>
                <p>When you say that you are trading in the stock market, it means that you are engaged in buying and selling shares on one or more exchanges in the world, which are part of the global stock market. Later in the article, we will talk about the world's largest stock exchanges, what is the first electronic American stock market in history, and more.

                </p>
                <h2 style="color:aliceblue;">What is trading in the stock market?</h2>
                <p>
                    Well now that we know what the stock market is, let's move on to the concept of trading in the stock market!
                    
                    Stock trading is the process of buying and selling shares (or securities) in publicly listed companies, at a price agreed upon by the seller and buyer for the possibility of making a profit. Nowadays it can happen from your computer, laptop or even mobile phone.
                    The buying and selling of shares in public companies is controlled and managed by an exchange such as the London Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange. Historically, traders have turned to these exchanges to buy and sell stocks with other traders in what was called the "trading pit".</p>
<h2 style="color:aliceblue;">The importance of the stock market</h2>
                    <p>
                        The stock market helps companies trade openly for new stock resources to grow by selling shares owned in the public market. The stock market is one of the most popular places for companies to raise money alongside debt markets, which are usually more enforceable but not publicly traded. The liquidity provided by equity stocks helps investors sell quickly and easily to liquidate their investments. It is an attractive feature over other less stable investments such as immovable property and real estate
                        In order for a company to issue shares to investors to buy and invest, the company must first comply with certain rules and regulations to be listed on the stock market and be able to offer public shares. For a company that goes public for the first time, this is called an initial public offering (IPO) and this happens through the stock market of course.</p>

                        <p>History has shown that stocks and other valuable assets are an important aspect of measuring economic conditions, and can influence or be predictive of the financial climate. When you see the stock market go up, you can also see that the economy in that place is developing. The stock market (stock market) is also used as a leading indicator of social sentiment and prosperity of a nation.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>
                How does the stock market work?
            </h2>
            <p>
               
The main role of the stock market comes by providing a safe and regulated environment for investors to perform their transactions and investments on various financial instruments without worrying about legal risks. This is granted when the exchange is operational and complies with the specific rules set by the regulator and licensor.
            </p>
            <p>To put it in a better perspective and in a simple way to understand, in short:</p>

            <p>1- The stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the public through the Initial Public Offering (IPO) process. It also allows other companies to issue more shares or even withdraw part of their shares if they already exist on the stock market.</p>
            <p>2- The stock market plays the role of a "market" and gives investors access to these companies that offer their shares for sale to the public.</p>
            <p>3- A stock market exchange is the physical form of an online trading platform offered by a broker for the purchase and sale of listed financial instruments.</p>

            <p>All this gives companies the opportunity to divide themselves into shares and raise money from it, and the opportunity for investors to buy and hold part of these shares for the required time, and to anticipate the rise in the share price and dividend payments in order to make an additional profit and income.</p>

            <p>
Currently, the total value of all the world's top sixty exchanges is about $69 trillion. However, more than 93% of this value is divided between three continents: North America, Asia and Europe. Here are 6 of the largest global market exchanges you need to know as a trader:
            </p>

            <h2>1. New York Stock Exchange</h2>
            <p>
                The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the most famous stock exchange in the world with its famous opening bell at 9:30 a.m. This global exchange, called "The Big Board," was founded in 1817 but did not operate under the name NYSE until 1963. Headquartered on 11 Wall Street in Manhattan, New York, the building was recognized as a national landmark in 1978.</p>

            <h2>
                2. Nasdaq
            </h2>
            <p>
                
                NASDAQ or "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations" is the second largest global exchange by market capitalization. NASDAQ is also located in New York - on the world-famous Times Square. It was founded in 1971 by NASD (National Association of Stock Traders) and was the first exchange of its kind at the time.</p>
               <p> Instead of using the traditional "open scream" method – which involved traders shouting buy and sell orders in trading positions – the NASDAQ exclusively worked to end this mess through computers and phones. This made Nasdaq, the world's first global electronic exchange, now specialized in listing technology-only companies in the U.S. market.</p>

            <h2>
                3. London Stock Exchange
            </h2>
            <p>
               
                The London Stock Exchange (LSE) originally began as a press release for the market price in 1698. However, in 1801 it began to facilitate the buying and sale of shares, making it one of the oldest world stock exchanges. In fact, it was the largest stock exchange in the world until the end of World War I, when the New York Stock Exchange ranked first.
            </p>
            <p>Headquartered in London's Paternoster Square, Britain, it lists more than 3,000 companies from more than seventy countries, making it the largest stock exchange in Europe, the sixth largest in the global financial markets, and the exchange with the largest number of global companies.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                4. Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Euronext
            </h2>
            <p>
                
                The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX) was founded in 1602 and was essentially a stock exchange for commodities rather than securities such as stocks and bonds. However, it went on to list the first-ever multinational company to issue shares – the Dutch East India Trading Company. That is why the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in the world and still in operation.

                The Xetra / Börse Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the largest of the seven German stock exchanges owned by Deutsche Börse AG. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange was originally founded in 1585 to exchange currency rates. However, it now facilitates advanced electronic trading of stocks and bonds listed in it through the complete electronic trading system.

                What do we trade on the stock exchange?
            </h2>
            <p>
                
When you hear the term stock exchange, most people think of stocks at first glance, but in fact we are not limited to trading stocks only, but we can buy and sell other financial instruments as well.

<p><strong>Equities</strong>
Stocks are actually parts of a company. When we own shares in a particular company, we have a small portion of it, and we are shareholders in it. This applies to joint stock companies and limited joint stock companies.
        
                Shares give the owner the right to claim a share of the company's assets in case of bankruptcy. Stocks are divided into two types: common and distinctive. Holders of ordinary shares have the right to receive a share of profits in addition to participating in the management of the company, while owners of preferred shares have the right to decide and receive a higher percentage of profits.</p>

               <p><strong>Indicators</strong> 
                A stock index is a basket of stocks representing companies in a particular country. The value of an index can be calculated in several ways, but it usually represents the average price of the stocks that make up a stock index. Major stock market indices, i.e. the most viewed by investors, generally include the largest companies in any country.

For example, the most popular DAX 30 stock market index in Germany consists of the 30 largest German companies (by market capitalization and liquidity).
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                <strong> ETFs</strong> 
Well, an ETF is nothing more than a listed mutual fund. Unlike trading stocks or other assets, an ETF can include a wide range of markets in which a trader can invest their money.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a group of securities that can be bought or sold on the stock market that replicates the movement of the underlying assets listed in your portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
               <strong> Forex</strong>
The currency market (also known as the forex market) is where currency pairs such as EURUSD or GBPUSD are exchanged in order to make potential profits from price movements in the market. The Forex market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market; investors and traders buy and sell currency pairs through it.
            </p>
            <p>Bonds
                Bonds are a type of debt. In other words, it is an actual bond (I owe you) and is actually a promise to pay that the issuer of the bond gave to the bondholder, according to the terms of the bond). The issuer of the bond bears the debt, and the person who buys the debt, the holder of the bond, is the one who saves the money.</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Goods</strong>
Under stable economic conditions, commodities, contracts that reflect the price of a particular asset, such as crude oil, precious metals and agricultural products, are traded exclusively in stocks. When the stock market falls, investors can usually turn to commodities for diversification. The best way for institutional investors to gain exposure to commodities is via exchange-traded funds or mutual funds. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In such economic conditions, the distinction between stocks and commodities is blurred. This was the case after the 2008 global crisis, when crude oil trading trends mimicked those on the stock exchange. Investors also tend to turn to gold in such conditions as markets are overwhelmed with uncertainty.
