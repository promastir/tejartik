        <p>Lavillette or affiliate marketing is a frequently repeated term today! It is a type of marketing that allows you to earn a commission on each sale made through you after you promote products that you do not sell. And affiliate is one of the most common ways to get from the Internet! You can earn income from the affiliate without the need for a physical presence on the ground or investment in the purchase and storage of products.</p>
        <p>And one of the most popular affiliate methods is the conversion link! The store owner you're going to promote gives you a link to a trackable product and puts it on your blog or YouTube channel! Thus, you take a commission on each sale made when customers enter through this link.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Affiliate Marketing</h2>
      <p>There is no doubt about the benefits and advantages of affiliate marketing, because it has become required in any marketing strategy for major companies and even the smallest! Thus let's find out together why affiliate marketing is important to you:</p>

      <ul class="ul2">
         <li>
            <h3>1. Saves your time and money</h3>
As we have already explained, affiliate marketing is a type of easy income that does not require you to invest a lot of time or money to get started! Finding, storing, packaging and shipping products is not your business or responsibility, and it is only your responsibility to market.
         </li>


         <li>
            <h3>2. Selling in remote locations</h3>
Have you ever thought about taking advantage of sales in places other than your own? Affiliate marketing allows you to do this by reaching the largest number of users! By reaching out to them and marketing them through various platforms and tools, you can increase your commission rates in places outside the country you are in.
         </li>
         <li>
            <h3>3. Earn more</h3>
In affiliate marketing, you are also a beneficiary in blogging for your customers and establishing a base based on trust and trust between you and your customers. In addition to the commission, at the same time the site gets a move to its sales and provides an opportunity to reduce inventory.
         </li>

         <li>
            <h3>4. Freedom of choice</h3>
It is up to you to decide which products or services to promote! So choosing solely between multiple options and according to the audience you like to deal with will be your choice.</li>
         <li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
           <h3> 5. Grow without risk</h3>
Affiliate marketing allows you to take the commission and the commission may be really large so that it may reach 70 percent of the price of the product, all this without risking as an affiliate marketer or even as a company or online store!

        <h2>How to get started and succeed in affiliate marketing?</h2>
        <p> 
            First: Choosing the right market
            If you have not launched your affiliate marketing project yet, the first thing you have to do is choose the market in which you want to specialize, do not try to mix products so as not to lose your audience, but rather specialize, and in any case these four directories will make you reach the market in which you want to do affiliate marketing:</p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <h2>Products that solve problems</h2>
        <p>
            
A market, any market, is nothing more than a place with a group of people who need and others who meet their common needs, so if people find a problem you have to give them the solution they need, which is the pain point that people need to heal quickly and heal here will be by buying the product.
        </p>
        <p>People's needs and problems are the key to the first sale, and you should never sell a product that you do not know will add value or solve a problem for your audience, otherwise you will be walking on your reputation with an eraser.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <h2>
            Products with a large market
        </h2>
        <p>

The larger the market, the greater the options to sell, but this may increase the factor of fierce competition and therefore it is better to segment the market and know the volume of people's search and demand for the product, and Google Ads and Google Keyword Planner will benefit you.
        </p>
     </div>
     <div>

        <p>

You can conduct extensive research and comprehensive analysis of the products surveyed and most in demand from people through Google trends or through the keyword planner to know which paths to take.
